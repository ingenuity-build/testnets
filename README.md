# Killer Queen
The Killer Queen testnet is named for the hit song "Killer Queen" written by Freddie Mercury, for his band Queen, back in 1974. For inspiration whilst joining this testnet, please feel free to listen to this in the background: [Killer Queen on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZBtPf7FOoM).

All Quicksilver testnets shall be named after songs by Freddie Mercury and/or Queen, for no reason more than the guy was a lyrical and musical genius, and there is a somewhat tenuous link between Quicksilver -> Mercury -> Freddie that is ripe for exploitation. 

Killer Queen testnet is twofold, and will support Validators, as well as Liquid Stakers on the User Interface. Validators that participated in Rhapsody, Quicksilver's initial tesnet, will get priority 

Additional tasks will be added incrementally during the coming days.

Additional information regarding the rewards distribution will be added during the coming days. 

Please be advised that the completion of a KYC process is necessary to be able to receive rewards. Instructions on how to complete the KYC process will be added during the coming days.
